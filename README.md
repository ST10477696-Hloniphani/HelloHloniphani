Explaination of the process: 
I set up my first React Native project using Visual Studio Code. 
I installed Node.js and the Expo CLI to create a new app template 
using the command npx create-expo-app HelloHloniphani. 
After the project was created, I ran the app locally using npx 
expo start and tested it with Expo Go. 
I then initialized a Git repository inside the project folder, 
configured my Git identity, committed my changes, 
and pushed the project to GitHub using the master branch.

The setup steps I followed: 
1. Installed Node.js – Required to use npm (Node Package Manager).
2. Installed Expo CLI – Used `npm install -g expo-cli` to install the Expo CLI globally.
3. Created a new project – Used `npx create-expo-app HelloHloniphani` to generate a new React Native project.
4. Opened the project in VS Code – Navigated to the project folder and opened it using Visual Studio Code.
5. Started the development server – Ran `npx expo start` to launch the app locally.
6. Installed Git** – Initialized Git in the project folder using `git init`.
7. Configured Git identity – Set up your name and email with `git config --global user.name` and `user.email`.
8. Committed your code – Used `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial commit"` to save your work.
9. Pushed to GitHub – Connected the local repo to GitHub and pushed using `git push -u origin master`.
